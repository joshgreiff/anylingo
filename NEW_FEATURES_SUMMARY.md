- **Feature**: When you select a speech rate (e.g., 0.7), it's now saved permanently
- **How it works**: Your speech rate preference is remembered across sessions
- **Benefit**: No need to adjust the rate every time you use Read Aloud

### 2. **Persistent Target Language Selection**
- **Feature**: When you select a target language (e.g., Spanish), it's saved permanently
- **How it works**: Your language preference is remembered and applied automatically
- **Benefit**: Faster translation workflow - no need to reselect language each time

### 3. **Automatic Translation Restart**
- **Feature**: Translation process restarts automatically when you click Translate
- **How it works**: Uses your saved target language preference
- **Benefit**: Consistent translation experience with your preferred language

### 4. **Text Selection and Highlighting**

- **How it works**: 
  - Click on any word to highlight the whole sentence in yellow
  - Select text manually to highlight specific portions
  - Highlights work in both original and translated text
- **Benefit**: Easy visual focus on specific content for translation

### 5. **Word-by-Word Highlighting During Speech**
- **Feature**: Words are highlighted in green as they're pronounced during Read Aloud
- **How it works**: 
  - Start Read Aloud and watch words light up in green as they're spoken
  - Visual synchronization with audio for better retention
  - Works with all speech rates
- **Benefit**: **Significant impact on retention** - visual + audio learning

## ðŸŽ¯ Educational Impact

These features specifically address your language learning methodology:

1. **Visual-Audio Synchronization**: Green word highlighting during speech creates a powerful visual-audio connection
2. **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Persistent settings mean less time adjusting controls, more time learning
3. **Focused Learning**: Sentence highlighting helps learners focus on specific content
4. **Consistent Experience**: Saved preferences create a personalized learning environment

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

- **User Preferences**: All settings are saved in browser storage
- **Real-time Highlighting**: Advanced timing algorithms for word synchronization
- **Cross-session Persistence**: Settings survive browser restarts
- **Performance Optimized**: Smooth highlighting without lag

## ðŸ“± How to Use

### Speech Rate & Language Settings:
1. Adjust speech rate slider â†’ automatically saved

## ðŸš€ Ready for Testing

All features are now live and ready for testing! The app should provide a much more intuitive and effective learning experience.

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

1. **Test the new features** with your language learning content
2. **Verify the visual-audio synchronization** works well for retention
3. **Check that persistent settings** work across browser sessions
4. **Share feedback** on any adjustments needed

The word highlighting during speech should have the significant retention impact you mentioned - it creates that crucial visual-audio connection that makes language learning much more effective!
